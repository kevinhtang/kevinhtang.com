I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I went to Stanford for my undergraduate studies, where I studied Symbolic Systems (Computer Science + Social Sciences) and Biology. After, I went to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine for medical school. I love exploring the outdoors, marking Google Maps with destinations and restaurants, driving and collecting old Toyota trucks, and watching random YouTube videos deep into the night.
